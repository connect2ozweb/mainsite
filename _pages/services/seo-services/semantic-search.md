<strong>Google semantic search</strong><br>
<p>1997’s Disney movie named Flubber about a professor and his
brilliant invention showed us what we see in today’s semantic search,
something called artificial intelligence. Weebo who’s the professor’s
personal device has the ability to access content from a huge pile of
information. Essentially, this is what google semantic search does – it
uses artificial intelligence to understand the meaning and intent of
the searcher’s query unlike determining a keyword like in a dictionary.
So then, google tries to decipher the relationship amongst the keywords
and how they work together, thereby trying to decode the meaning and
spilling out the closest search results. </p>
<p>Search Engine Land defines semantic search as a ‘unique search
system that considers factors such as search context, location, and
intent. Semantics can also search based on word variations, synonyms,
specialized and generalized queries, concept matching, and natural
language queries.’</p>
<p>Search is a very important constituent of web. The sea of
information that’s available on websites would’ve been impossible to
access had there been no search. Search is therefore an important tool
to navigate the web. However, search is ambiguous. Not a long time ago
we had to depend on boolean search which is a statistical analysis tool
that uses the searchers ‘and’, ‘not’, ‘or’ and ‘near’ keywords to
develop a probability model of answers to a search query. Boolean
search relied on keywords and hoard of other complex factors. Seo, has
therefore become such a big game with often a dodgy repute but with the
advent of Semantic search, its becoming easier to find better and more
accurate search results. For example, if one puts a query like, ‘what
is the capital of Australia’, it provides a straightforward answer
right on the search page itself.</p>

<p><strong>The Pillar of Semantic Search<br></strong>
Google’s Knowledge Graph which is clustered information that strives to
provide answers to possible search queries that searchers put in. So
now google has the ability to make sense of the search query and with
the help of knowledge graph its able to furnish contextual information
as SERPs do not display just 10 blue links anymore.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>
Where does this position seo?<br></strong>
Its easier to play with keywords but not with the intent so if a
website has to rank higher in semantic search, its not just enough for
its web pages to have the right mix of keywords but it should also have
its content created in such a way as to bring out the real meaning of
that search query. With semantic search deciphering the meaning of the
keywords to give accurate results will play an important role. When
writing content the focus will have to be on the natural language for a
person when he requests a query even though the searcher still focuses
on keywords.</p><p>

<strong>Methodologies of Search Semantics<br></strong>
Semantic search is dependant on language semantics. It is based on the
intent, context, substance and idea of searched phrase. It also
includes term synonyms, location, variations in words, current trends
and some natural language aspects as part of the search. Different
search algorithms and methodologies build Semantic search concepts. <br>
According to Mäkelä there are five main methodologies:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>RDF Path Traversal – spanning the net
made by an information graph that makes use of RDF data model.</li>
  <li>Mapping concepts to keywords</li>
  <li>Graph Patterns – are used to make
patterns to establish impressive interlinked paths between the
resources. These are generally also used for data visualization.</li>
  <li>Logics – based on deductions from OWL</li>
  <li>Fuzzy concepts, fuzzy logics and fuzzy
relations</li>
</ul>

<strong>Web Security and its Importance</strong>
<p>Almost everything today relies on web. Be it communication through emails or phones, transportation with the aid of Satnavs or airline navigation, ecommerce, entertainment or medicine, all bet their bottom dollar on web. Obama administration claimed in their 2009 cyberspace policy review that “threats to cyberspace pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges of the 21st century for the United States and our allies.”</p>
<p>Not only the US but corporations and governments globally have understood that web security is of utmost importance. Web security is protecting the confidentiality, availability and integrity of web by hampering, identifying and combating such threats.</p>
<p>Majority of people aren’t aware about the risks and repercussions involved and think that being small business owners renders them risk free as they would not come in the eyes of hackers. However, they cannot imagine the kind of automated tools hackers possess to damage such unguarded websites. Its very easy not imagine oneself facing such threats.</p>
<strong>Why is Web security important?</strong>
<p>As a website is the window to a company, the customers needs to feel safe to start business with that company. Threats such as malware jeopardize the visitors coming to the website by stealing their information like identity, email addresses, credit card information, bank information etc. Oftentimes, such malware add the website to a botnet of corrupt websites eventually hijacking and crashing it.
Even a single security breach for a small business could cause a deathly blow as the laws have become very strict with regards to security breach issues. The customers could lose trust with the business. Security threats are not just catastrophic for businesses themselves but to other businesses, government/public websites and national security.</p>

Some popular web security terms are hackers, virus, Trojan horses, worms, firewalls, keyloggers etc.

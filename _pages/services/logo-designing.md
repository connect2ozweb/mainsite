<p>My friend makes sure his driver is always around his BMW in the parking lot as many a time’s people steal the logo from the steering wheel which is even more expensive than the wheel.</p>

<p>Such is the importance of a logo design; it carries price, name and brand value of a commodity. Hence a logo needs to be catchy, unique and uncomplicated.</p><p>

</p><p>When someone says apple, we most likely imagine a silver coloured half-eaten apple instead of a red one, when someone says Pepsi we imagine a wavy red, blue and white coloured ball. Logo design is stuck in our head; we recognize the brand because of the logo.</p>

<p>Logo design should be such that it builds trust in customers. The words in the logo shouldn’t mix with logo as the text then becomes illegible. For logo design, one should keep in mind the colour, shape, typography and scale. The target audience is important; the Pepsi logo is a ball and has a funky look because the makers knew it would attract youngsters.</p>

<p>If you want a logo that can increase the product-value and allure audience then you have come to the right place. Think no further and place your order.</p>

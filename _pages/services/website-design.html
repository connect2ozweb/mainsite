<strong>DESIGN BEAUTIFULLY:</strong>
<p> A website design should be neat and alluring. We follow W3 guidelines to make your website look neat and alluring </p>

<p><img src="{{ 'assets/uploads/2015/03/webdesign-1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="webdesign-1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-725" srcset="{{ 'wp-content/uploads/2015/03/webdesign-1.jpg' | relative_url }} 496w, {{ 'wp-content/uploads/2015/03/webdesign-1-300x181.jpg' | relative_url }} 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px" width="496" height="300"></p>

<strong>Fonts:</strong>
<p>We can read your needs. Fonts are the most important yet most overlooked feature in websites. The font for a movie title says a lot about the movie. It is imperative to start from the start. People will only read what’s on your website if they can hold their eyes to the font, what the content entails comes second.</p>
<strong>Sliders:</strong>
<p>Many people don’t prefer to slide pages after pages to see the entire content; they prefer to see the gist on the homepage to see if they ought to invest their time on a particular website.</p>


<strong>Videos, Images and Animation:</strong>
<p>People prefer watching and listening to reading. To make your matter more engaging use short videos, images and animation. This trend is on and is being widely used.</p>
<p>In most social media platforms and similar arenas people usually get to convey their message in about 200 words or so. It gets easy for people to navigate the page at a rushed speed with so many distractions pulling them in various directions.
Ad free:</p>
<p>You can be the owner of your page with just your content sans Ads and unneeded side-diversions. That way the visitor can just concentrate on your web page.</p>

<strong>MANAGING YOUR WEBSITE: </strong>
<p>A website once made is not the end of the game, the game then starts. Irrespective of your website being personal or commercial it needs to be updated from time to time. Even if you are a novice in the technical world it won’t take much time to get the hang of user friendly Content Management Systems like Joomla and WordPress. You can upload images or add and edit matter on the site as per your need and time. These features however are not of much relevance for small and static websites.</p>
<strong>REPORT CARD:</strong>
<p>With ‘Google Analytics’ feature that we provide, you will be able to see a report of how many people visited your website, the most searched content on your website and the type of people who visited your profile to name a few features. It is an important aspect to help upgrade your website in accordance to that.</p>
<strong>SEO:</strong>
<p>The most important feature we provide is SEO which is a must if you want your website to be clicked. If it isn’t on the first page of Google, its existence doesn’t matter.</p>
<strong>UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR (URL):</strong>
<p>It should be short, simple and unique like ‘google.com’ or ‘flipkart.com’. They are easy to type and remember. These URLs give a hint of what the website is about. ‘Google.com’ wouldn’t have been that appealing had it been named ‘searchwhatyoulike.com’. 
We will make sure your website has the content with the right blend of tags, meta-links and CSS.</p>
